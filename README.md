## 📌 Project Overview

This project is a **real-time handwritten digit recognition system** built using a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** trained on the **MNIST dataset**. It captures live webcam input, applies a series of image preprocessing techniques via **OpenCV**, and predicts the handwritten digit (0–9) along with a confidence score.

The system comes with **two interface options**:
- 🖥️ **Tkinter Desktop App**   A dark-themed native GUI that shows the live camera feed, detected digit, and confidence score.

## ✨ Features

- 🎥 **Live Webcam Feed**   Captures frames in real-time directly from your webcam
- 🧠 **CNN-based Digit Classification**   Pre-trained on the MNIST dataset to classify digits 0–9 with high accuracy
- 🔲 **Bounding Box Detection**   Automatically draws a bounding box around the largest detected digit contour
- 🧹 **Advanced Image Preprocessing**   Applies Gaussian blur, adaptive thresholding, and morphological operations for clean digit isolation
- 📊 **Confidence Score Display**   Shows prediction confidence in real-time; uncertain predictions below the threshold are filtered out
- 🔄 **Prediction Smoothing**   Uses a rolling history buffer (`deque`) to stabilize predictions and reduce flickering
- ⚡ **FPS Tracking**   Built-in frame rate calculation for performance monitoring
- 🎛️ **User Interface**   Run as a desktop app (Tkinter) app

## 🔍 Implementation Highlights

### Image Preprocessing Pipeline
The raw webcam frame goes through several OpenCV transformations before being fed to the model:
- **Gaussian Blur** smooths out noise in the frame
- **Adaptive Thresholding** binarizes the image based on local pixel intensity, making it robust to lighting changes
- **Morphological Opening** removes small noise blobs while preserving the digit shape
- The largest contour (by area) is selected, cropped, padded to a square, and resized to the MNIST-standard **28×28 pixels**

### Prediction Stability
To avoid flickering predictions frame-to-frame, the system maintains a **rolling buffer** using Python's `deque` (size = 20 frames). Only predictions with confidence **above 60%** are added to this buffer. The final displayed digit is the **most frequent prediction** in the buffer, ensuring visual stability.

### Model
The CNN model (`digit_cnn_model.keras`) was trained on the **MNIST dataset**   60,000 training images of handwritten digits (0–9) at 28×28 pixels. It was saved in Keras's native `.keras` format for efficient loading.
